# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the RCOS Observatory!
Please read the following guidelines before opening an issue or
pull request.

## Git Contribution Style

We use a "blessed repository" style of development, meaning no one is intended
to push commits directly. Instead all contributions should follow the
fork-and-pull method. This is common for GitHub and their guides on it are a
great place to start https://guides.github.com/.

## Conduct

Please conduct yourself in a respectful and professional manner.
For more details please see the offical
[RCOS Code of Conduct](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT)
in the [RCOS Handbook](https://handbook.rcos.io)

## Style

Please ensure that any contributions follow good code style.
We suggest running an auto-formatter on your code before submitting it.

For Rust we suggest using the official `rustfmt` tool to format to code.

For HTML and JavaScript there are a variety of acceptable tools, `prettier`
would be a good choice.

## Documentation

Project-level documentation can be found in the [docs folder](./docs) and
contributions and improvements are greatly welcomed!

Any contributions to Observatory should be properly documented using the
in-code RustDoc format. More information about how to do this can be
found in the
[Rust Book here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#making-useful-documentation-comments).

Please be descriptive in your documentation, it helps both you and us to
understand your code better and really adds to maintainability. You don't have
to write a book, but at least explain what the code does and why.
