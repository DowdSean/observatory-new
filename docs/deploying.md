# Setup

There are two major ways of install Observatory-new. The first is a traditional
manual install from source, while the second uses the [Docker](https://docker.com)
container management system to make deployment simpler.

Generally speaking we recommend using Docker, however that may sometimes not
be ideal or even possible.

__**Please Note**__ that all versions of Observatory-new do not provide SSL/TLS
support out of the box. We highly suggest using a reverse proxy such
as NGINX or HAProxy in order to increase security.

## Docker

[Docker](https://docker.com) is a container runtime and management system that
makes deploying and updating applications easy and painless.

This is the recommended way of install Observatory.

Note that for all `docker` commands you will either need to be part of the
`docker` group or run the command as root with `sudo`.

### Building

The Docker image can be built using the following command from the directory
containing the `Dockerfile`.

```
$ docker build -t rcos/observatory .
```

### Running
Observatory can be run with Docker with the following command once it has been
built or pulled.

```
$ docker run --name observatory -i -p 8000:8000 rcos/observatory
```

Once that is running Observatory-new will be available on port 8000.

### Mounts

The only mount of interest is the database which is stored at
`/var/lib/observatory/` and can be mounted to the host system using the
`-v` flag or eqivalent.

## Manual

This is for a manual installation on a bare Unix-like OS.
We also provide Docker images for easier automated deployment.

The first 3 steps can be performed on any machine so long as it is the same
architecture and `libc` as the server.

The first few steps are quite similar to the [Building section in the README](./README.md#Building)

### Release Build

First you will have to build Observatory-new in release mode. This can be done
easily with
```
$ cargo build --release
```

This will take some time and quite a bit of CPU power as Observatory uses
aggressive opimization by default.

### Copy files to Server and Run

Now that all this is done, assuming you built the code on a machine other than
the server, you must copy the files over. There are only 3 necessary files to copy:

- `observatory` from `target/release/` to anywhere on the server.
- `Rocket.toml` to the same folder as `observatory`.

Once all that is done you can simply run the `observatory` file and it will be
available on port 8000.

## Configuration

The configuration for the server lives in `Rocket.toml`. While we have strived
for sane defaults you may want to change things in it.

If the config file cannot be found at runtime Observatory will attempt to generate
one based on the default values.

Runtime configuration can be done using enviroment variables.
See [this page in the Rocket documentation](https://rocket.rs/guide/configuration/#environment)
for more information.

If you did not set your secret key before building you should do so
using an enviroment variable.
